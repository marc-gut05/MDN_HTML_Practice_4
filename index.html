      <h1>Advanced Text Formatting</h1>
    
            <h2>Description Lists</h2>
      <p>This is mainly used to separate terms with their descriptions. The term &lt;dt&gt; stands for <strong>description term</strong> while &lt;dd&gt; stands for <storng>description definiton</storng>.
      <br><br>
      For example:
      </p>
      <img src="Pictures/Description%20List%20Example.PNG" width="500px">
      <p>Here is an example of the list when the example above is implemented within the html document itself.</p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>soliloquy</dt>
            <dd>In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)</dd>
        <dt>monologue</dt>
            <dd>In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.</dd>
        <dt>aside</dt>
            <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
      </dl>
      
     <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
      <p>Th purpose of blockquotes is to cite an entire block level of content such as paragraphs or lists by including a URL of the source.<br><br> Below is how a blockquote is represented within the browser</p>
      
      <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
      <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
    Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Below is an example of how the blockquote is represented in the text editor.</p>
      
      <img src="Pictures/Blockquote%20example.PNG" width="700">
      
      <h2>Inline Quotations</h2>
        <p>Inline quotations serve the same purpose as block quotes, but represents itself differently within the browser. Using the &lt;q&gt; element within the text editor wraps whatever is written within the element in quotations.<br><br>Below is an example of how Inline Quotatios represents itself in the browser.</p>
      
      <p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>
      
      <p>Below is how Inline Quotations are written in the text editor.</p>
      <img src="Pictures/Inline%20Quote%20example.PNG" width="700px">
      
      <h2>Citations</h2>
      <p>Citations are an important part of all information transfer. Having robust information displayed on your website is important, but allowing for there to be a clear path to the source that informed the interpretation is essential to creating trust and maintaining integrity. The need for citations is not only essential in collegiate writing, but in everyday life. Interpretations are important, but facts are paramount in all instances of media, literature, and conversation. <br><br></p>
      <p>Unfortunately for readers of the website, browsers can not do much with included citations. Broswers do not display these citations, so it is important to incorporate these citations in a different fashion.<br><br>Instead of using the &lt;cite&gt; element to include a citation within the browser, we will use the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element to create a hyperlink attached to a piece of text.<br><br> Below is an example of incorporating a link into a line of text.</p>
      
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/" target="_blank">United States Census Bureau</a> the United States population stands at just below 330 million people, with one birth occuring nearly every 8 seconds, one death occuring every 12 seconds, an addition of one international migrant every 46 seconds, and a net gain of one person every 17 seconds.<br><br> 
      The United States Census also states that the population of <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/TX/PST045219#" target="_blank">Texas</a> as of July 1st, 2019 is estimated to be just under 29 million consisting of <strong>12.6%</strong> being persons 65 years and over, <strong>25.8%</strong> being persons under the age of 18, and <strong>7.1%</strong> being persons under the age of 5. This website does not include a percentage of people ages 18 through 65, but using arithmetic we can deduce the percentage for that age range. <br><br>
      First, we will add the percentage of persons 65 and over with persons under 18 years of age. However, we will <strong>not</strong> add percentage of persons under 5 years, because it is included within the persons under 18 years. Given that 25.8% and 12.6% equals 38.4%, we can subtract that from 100% and reveal that <strong>61.6%</strong> of the population in Texas is comprised of persons between the ages of 17 and 65.</p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>Below is how the code for the citations section was written within the text editor.</p>
      
      <img src="Pictures/Hyperlinks%20as%20citations.PNG" width="500px">
    
      <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
        <p>Abbreviations take an acronym or abbreviation within the text and shows the full version when the word comes into contact with the mouse pointer. The element is written within the &lt;p&gt; element, encasing the intended acronym.<br><br>
        Below is an example of how the code will be represented in the browser:</p>
        
        <h3>Example</h3>
        
        <p>The <abbr title="American Association of Retired Persons">AARP</abbr> is an organization dedicated to focusing on issues affecting the elderly.</p>
      
        <p>The use of the abbreviation <abbr title="Talt to you later">TTYL</abbr> has fallen in and out of popularity and is usually not an active saying with most people, but was shown in popular media as a sterotype.</p>
        
        <p>Here is how the code looks like in the code editor:</p>
        <img src="Pictures/Abbreviation%20Example.PNG" width="800">
      
        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Contact information is important to display because it gives proper credit to the creator of the website, company or whomever may be associated with the browser page. Contact information can be formatted regularly without the use of a special element, but the &lt;address&gt; makes it easier by allowing for the text within it to be inately italicized.<br><br> Below is an example of how the element is represented in the browser.</p>
        
        <address>
            <p>
               Marcos Gutierrez<br>
               El Paso<br>
               Texas<br>
               USA<br>
            </p>
        </address>
      

       <p>Here is how the address element is used in the text editor:<br>
       Note how the &lt;br&gt; (break) element is used to lightly format the text.</p>
      
      <img src="Pictures/Contact%20Information%20Example.PNG" width="250"><br><br>
      <code>&lt;img src="Pictures/Contact%20Information%20Example.PNG" width="250"&gt;</code>
      
      <h2>Superscript and Subscript</h2>
      <p>Superscript and subscript text is an important part of any math or science based information that is displayed on a browser. This is acheived by using the &lt;sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt; elements within a &lt;p&gt; element. Below is an example of how the elements will represent themselves in the browser.</p>
      
      <p>My birthday is on the 13<sup>th</sup> of May.<br><br> Here is how the code is written within the text editor:</p>
      <img src="Pictures/superscript%20practice.PNG" width="500">
      
      <h2>Representing Computer Code</h2>
      <p>As I have been writing this page, I have used screenshots of text within my editor to display them, but there is another way to display code with less steps. This way involves using several elements such as &lt;code&gt; and &lt;pre&gt; to wrap code that we want presented in the browser.<br><br> When we wrap our code with the &lt;code&gt; element, it displays the text without any formatting that may exist in the text editor. This means that the code will be displayed all on the same line, with the base readable space between each character. If any formatting is wanted, the code wrapped with the &lt;code&gt; element must be also wrapped in the &lt;pre&gt; element. Adding the &lt;pre&gt; element allows the text editor to differentiate between indetations, regular spaces, and enter spaces.<br><br>Below is an example of using only the &lt;code&gt; element followed by the same text using both the &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt;elements. Notice how the font and point size change with these added elements.</p>

<code>var para = document.querySelector('p');
para.onclick = function() {
alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
      }</code>
      
      <br><br>
      
<pre><code>var para = document.querySelector('p');
para.onclick = function() {
alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
      }</code></pre>
      
     <p>While this is useful to use when there is a want for plain-text in the editor, I prefer screenshots because they allow for the unique color-coordination that text editors apply, which is why I will include the following screenshot.</p>
      
    <img src="Pictures/Representing%20Computer%20code%20practice.PNG" width="400">
      
    <p>Representing computer code is done by many more elements than just the code a pre elements. Here is a helpful screenshot from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting" target="_blank">Mozilla Development Network website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Marking up Times and Dates</h2>
      
      <p>Having an ability to mark dates in the browser creates more opportunity for the utilization of these dates within css or javascript. However, it is not as simple as writing today's date or the current time and wrapping it with the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element and being finished. Due to the variety of formats and languages that people write dates and times, the element <code>datetime</code> must also be utilized within the <code>&lt;time&gt; element.</code><br><br> The <code>datetime</code> element works by numerically specifying the date in the order of <code>Year-Month-DayTHour:Minute:Seconds.Miliseconds+offset of Hour:Minute.</code><br><br> The code would be written as such:</p>
    
      <code>&lt;time datetime="2020-06-28T17:00:00+00:00"&gt; It is currently 5:00 PM on Sunday, June 28<sup>th</sup>, 2020.&lt;/time&gt;</code>
      
      <p>Here is the same code in practice:</p>
      
      <time datetime="2020-06-28T17:00:00+00:00"> It is currently 5:00 PM on Sunday, June 28th, 2020.</time>
      
      <p>Here is a longer list of examples provided by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting" target="_blank">Mozilla Development Network website</a></p>
